      # Line Numbers based on https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/3#issuecomment-830564854
      # TODO: This approach has two limitations
      #   1. uesio themes do not currently support "dark:<token>" keys so to workaround, not specifying text-slate-600 for light theme (our normal color) and instead relying on the shiki currentColor based on theme
      #   2. The w-8 does not accomodate larger numbers (e.g., 10000+) and also takes up more space than needed for smaller numbers. Need to
      #      refine this approach to use something like expressive code (https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/876a8cd5b20cb917188ff9ad911820bfbc2c7ea7/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-line-numbers/src/index.ts#L41)
      #      and monaco-editor where an actual gutter is created that flexes width as needed. For now, we accomodate 9999 lines while still ensuring that all numbers right align. Numbers greater than 9999
      #      will still display, but the right alignment will be off with the smaller numbers.
