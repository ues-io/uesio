## What makes ues.io unique?

There are many "low-code" application development platforms out there. Why does the world need another one? We don't believe this problem has been sufficiently solved and belive our platform is unique for the following reasons.

### Thoughful abstractions

We believe that the ues.io abstractions are an intuitive way to think about app development. We'd love to see these ideas adopted broadly and possibly contribute to an accepted standard for high-level declarative development.

### A package manager for declarative development

With the bundle store, we're building a marketplace for apps, components, data structures and more. Tap into an ecosystem to monetize your apps, or to accellerate your own app development.

### A community of builders

We want to foster a thriving communitiy of builders. Ask questions and share ideas on our online community forum.

### Immutable environments

Full isolation of development and production environments. This provides an always available application for end users, removing risks from bugs.

### Multi-tenant by design

With ues.io you can have as many dev, test or prod environments as you want. Just create another site. Data is isolated between your environments.

### Generators

Generators allow you to create multiple metadata items of different types all as a single process. Use built-in generators or create your own.

### Configuration as code

At ues.io we don't consider ourselves a "low-code" platform. Whether your app is defined as imperitive code or declarative configuration, it still exists. We don't try to hide that from you. With ues.io you can still edit your configuration in your favorite IDE manage changes with source control.
