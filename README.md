# Uesio

![Uesio Logo](./libs/uesioapps/uesio/bundle/files/logo.png)

Uesio is a low-code application development platform.

## Monorepo architecture

The present monorepo hosts several standalone `applications` which in turn can reuse code lying in the `libs` folder.

The monorepo is managed by a tool called [nx](https://nx.dev/).

The `workspace.json` file holds the configuration on how each application and lib should be built, tested, linted.

## Set up dev environment

- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for macOS user)
- Install git

- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node.js and npm)
- ```
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and plugins (ESLint, Prettier, Go, GitLens)

- git clone repo (ssh method is prefered)
- Download the npm module dependencies

```
  npm install
```

- Optional : install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Optional : [Add a SSH key to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- Optional: install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (for macOS user)
- Optional :
  ```
  npm install -g nx
  ```
- Optional: create a file called `launch.json` located in `apps/.vscode` for the uesio server debugger in go and paste the following :

```
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
    "name": "Launch",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "launch",
    "mode": "debug",
    "program": "\${workspaceRoot}",
    "env": {},
    "args": ["serve"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Build

A standalone application within the monorepo is in charge of the building process, namely the `cli`. This `cli` is called under the hood by `nx`.

1. Build all applications. Compilation of the go code (code server-side) and transpilation from TS to JS (code client-side).

```
npm run build-all
```

2. Build a dedicated app (without watcher and without source map)

```
cd ./libs/uesioapps/crm && ../../../apps/cli/bin/run pack
```

or

```
npm run nx -- build uesioapps-crm
```

or (if you have `nx` install globally)

```
nx run uesioapps-crm:build
```

3. Build a dedicated app with watcher and source map

On the frontend, the `source map` is enabled in webpack in `dev` mode. As an example,
while developping you might want to rebuilt on saving with the source map in the browser :

```
cd ./libs/uesioapps/uesio && ../../../apps/cli/bin/run pack --develop
```

## Uesio apps deployment

**Uesio apps** such as the **uesio crm** are applications which can be plugged into the uesio system. These uesio apps are located in the `uesioapps` directory which is under the `libs` folder.

For plugging such an application into uesio, you have to deploy it obviously after having built it. This deployment process is done by the `cli`.

```
cd ./libs/uesioapps/crm && ../../../apps/cli/bin/run deploy
```

## Set up SSL

```
npm run setup-ssl
```

This script should create the `certificate.crt` and `private.key` files in the apps/platform/ssl directory. You will need to configure your operating system to trust this self-signed certificate.

In windows, double-click certificate.crt in the File Explorer. Click "Install Certificate..." Then place the certificate in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".

In mac, double-click certificate.crt in Finder. Right-click on the uesio-dev.com certificate and select "Get Info". Expand the "Trust" section and set it to "Always Trust".

## Set up DNS

On Mac modify the `/etc/hosts` file to include the following lines

```
127.0.0.1 uesio-dev.com
127.0.0.1 studio.uesio-dev.com
127.0.0.1 www.uesio-dev.com
```

Mac users can also use a service called dnsmasq for managing local DNS, but that has not been documented yet.

## Seed Local Database with Test Data

```
npm run nx -- seed platform
```

## Run the application Locally

```
npm run nx -- serve platform
```

In a browser visit

```
https://uesio-dev.com:3000
```

## Local Development with the Firestore Emulator

```
firebase init firestore
```

```
firebase emulators:start
```

In a browser visit

```
http://localhost:4000/firestore/
```

## Local Development with a database in Docker

0. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
1. Create a **docker container** based on a remote docker **image** - _e_._g_. `mysql`. - and tag a `CONTAINER_NAME` - _e_._g_. `mysql-container-uesio`.

```
docker run --name mysql-container-uesio -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=tcm -d mysql
```

2. Check if your container is up and running. You have information about the container **id** and **name**.

```
docker ps
```

3. Get in the container and create a database.

```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash
```

```
./usr/bin/mysql --user=root --password=tcm
```

```
CREATE DATABASE `test-cf94a`;
```

4. Optional. Stop the container (which is as a normal process) when no need to have it running.

```
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
```

5. Optional. Start an existing container

```
docker start CONTAINER_NAME
```

6. Optional. Remove the docker container when no longer needed.

```
docker rm -f CONTAINER_NAME
```

## Create a new project inside the monorepo

```
nx g @nrwl/workspace:library MY_PROJECT
```

## Connecting to a real Firestore instance

1. First set up your google cloud SDK and your first project (see above)
2. Initialize Firestore to be "Native Firestore"
3. Follow the steps laid out here to get a application credentials json file.
   https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/quickstart-servers#set_up_authentication
4. Place this JSON content of this file in the GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY environment variable wrapped in `''`, example: `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY='{ JSON CONTENT }'`
5. Make sure that the FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST variable is either an empty string or not set.
6. `firebase emulators:start`
7. Try to run seeds
8. If seeds were successful - enjoy your cloud based firestore instance.
