# About Uesio

![Uesio Logo](./libs/apps/uesio/core/bundle/files/favicon/uesiofav.svg)

Uesio is a **low-code** application development platform.

# Set up dev environment

## Required

- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for macOS user)
- Install git
- Install GitHub Desktop [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (for ensuring that your version of Node.js matches the version used in the repo): `nvm install`
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Install the following brew packages:
    - `hurl` (for integration tests): `brew install hurl`
    - `jq` (for JSON manipulation in Shell): `brew install jq`
    - `wget` (for fetching URLs): `brew install wget`
- Start dependencies [here](#dependencies).
- [Build](#build)
- [Run](#run).

## Optional

- Set up SSL [here](#set-up-ssl). If you don't set up SSL locally and you still want to run multiple sites locally in addition to the ues.io studio, you will need to set the `UESIO_ALLOW_INSECURE_COOKIES` environment variable to `true`
- Set up local DNS [here](#set-up-local-dns) This is also necessary if you want to run multiple sites locally in addition to the ues.io studio. By default, you can access the studio at `http://localhost:3000`
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and plugins (ESLint, Prettier, Go, GitLens). Do enable `format on save` in conjunction with the `Prettier`. Set up the `code` [environment variable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).
- Install the following [Google Chrome plugins](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) : `React Developers Tools`, `Redux DevTools`.
- Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Add a SSH key to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- Install the `nx` cli globally: `npm i -g nx`
- An alternative to installing `nx` globally is to set an alias in your `~/.zshrc` file or equivalent: `alias nx="npx nx"`. This way your global nx version will always be the correct version.

```
    npm run dev
```

- _Optional_. Create a file called `launch.json` located in `apps/.vscode` for the uesio server debugger in Go and paste the following :

```
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
    "name": "Launch",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "launch",
    "mode": "debug",
    "program": "${workspaceRoot}",
    "env": {},
    "args": ["serve"]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Build

- Download and install the npm module dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Build all applications and libs

```
npm run build-all
```

## Build a dedicated app (no watcher and no source map)

```
cd ./libs/apps/uesio/studio && uesio pack

// or
npm run nx -- build apps-uesio-studio

// or, if you have nx installed globally (or aliased)
nx build apps-uesio-studio
```

## Watch mode (for development)

While developing you may want the entire monorepo to rebuild changed files. You can do this with:

```
npm run watch-all
```

## (Optional) Using Uesio CLI globally

If you'd like to use the Uesio CLI that you have built elsewhere on your machine without having to explicitly reference the binary in `dist/cli`:

- Mac OS/Linux: create a symlink for the Uesio CLI into your bin (NOT an alias, which won't work with `nx`): `sudo ln -s <absolute project root path>/dist/cli/uesio /usr/local/bin`
- Windows: add `<absolute project root path>/dist/cli` to your PATH

# <a id="dependencies"></a>Start dependencies

1. Launch all local dependencies (e.g. Postgres) with Docker Compose:

```
docker compose up -d
```

2. Seed your local Postgres database with everything Uesio needs for local development

```
npm run migrations
npm run seeds
```

# <a id="run"></a>Run the web application locally

```
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

If you have [SSL](#set-up-ssl) and [local DNS](#set-up-your-local-dns) configured, you can access the Studio via the following "local" DNS:

```
open https://studio.uesio-dev.com:3000
```

To run the app in Docker locally:

```
npm run in-docker
open https://studio.uesio-dev.com:3000
```

**NOTE**: Docker Compose aggressively caches, so to force the app to rebuild the image (e.g. to rebuild JS / Go source), use this instead:

```
npm run in-docker-force-build
```

# <a id="set-up-ssl"></a> Set up SSL

SSL is optional for local development. It is enabled using by setting the environment variable `UESIO_USE_HTTPS=true`

```
npm run setup-ssl
```

This script should create the `certificate.crt` and `private.key` files in the `apps/platform/ssl` directory.

On Windows/Linux, you will need to manually trust this self-signed certificate. On Mac OS, this is done automatically.

- Windows: double-click certificate.crt in the File Explorer. Click "Install Certificate..." Then place the certificate in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".

# <a id="set-up-local-dns"></a> Set up your local DNS

If you just want to work in the Uesio Studio site, local DNS setup is not necessary, you can just access "http://localhost:3000".

However, to simmulate how Uesio routes DNS domains and subdomains to Uesio sites, you need to configure your OS to properly route "local" DNS domains (e.g. "uesio-dev.com") to the Uesio app server running on localhost.

There are two ways to do this, you'll need to pick one:

1. Modify /etc/hosts directly

    On Mac/Linux, modify the `/etc/hosts` file to resolve local subdomains to 127.0.0.1

    `bash ./scripts/seed-etc-hosts.sh`

2. Use DNSMasq

    ```
    brew install dnsmasq
    ```

    The installation process will output several commands that you can use to start Dnsmasq automatically with a default configuration. I used the following commands but you should use whichever commands brew tells you to:

    ```
    sudo brew services start dnsmasq
    ```

## Worker jobs

There are a number of worker jobs which Uesio runs in production, to handle things such as usage event aggregation, daily invoice generation, and potentially other future use cases (such as scheduled bots).

To run the worker process, use `npm run nx -- worker platform` (Or `nx worker platform` if you have nx installed globally):

```
> nx run platform:worker

{"message":"Running Uesio worker process","severity":"INFO"}
{"message":"Scheduling job Invoices with schedule: @daily","severity":"INFO"}
{"message":"Scheduling job Usage with schedule: * * * * *","severity":"INFO"}
{"message":"Finished loading all jobs, starting scheduler now...","severity":"INFO"}
{"message":"Cron job Invoices (1) next run will be at: Mar 22 00:00:00","severity":"INFO"}
{"message":"Cron job Usage (2) next run will be at: Mar 21 20:09:00","severity":"INFO"}

```

</table>

In addition, all Uesio Secrets can have their default value set by setting a corresponding `UESIO_SECRET_<namespace>_<name>` environment variable. Any value set for these secrets in a Site/Workspace will override the environment variable default, but it can often be useful, especially for local development, to configure a default value, so that you don't have to populate these secrets in every site. (Note: there is no corresponding feature for Config Values, because you can define a Config Value's default directly in the metadata definition).

For example, the `uesio/appkit.resend_key` secret's default value can be configured with `export UESIO_SECRET_UESIO_APPKIT_RESEND_KEY=your-resend-key`

# npm dependencies

As mentioned in the [monorepo](#monorepo-structure) section, a single `package.json` file describes the npm dependencies for the whole monorepo.

All npm modules we used are installed as `development` dependency since uesio is not intended to be released as standalone npm module.

### Migrations

We use `golang-migrate` package for running SQL migrations. This package maintains the current state of migration runs via a `schema_migrations` table.

Migrations can be run against your local using `npm run migrations`, or you can use `./uesio migrate [up|down] [NUMBER]` to manually run a specific number of migrations, e.g. to undo the most recent migration, you can run `./uesio migrate down 1`.

To run migrations in ECS, create a new one-off Task, using the latest Task Definition for "uesio", and modify the command to be `./uesio,migrate` (or `./uesio,migrate,down,1`) to undo one migration)

#### adding migrations

New migrations can be created using `npm run migrate:create -- <SOME_NAME>`

#### manually setting the migration "pointer"

To forcibly set the migration version to latest (currently 4), you can either use `pgcli` or some other DB tool to manually run the command `update schema_migrations set version = 4, dirty = false` against your database, or use this (assuming you install `golang-migrate` with brew):

```
brew install golang-migrate
export CONN_STR="postgres://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgresio?sslmode=disable"
migrate -path apps/platform/migrations -database "$CONN_STR" force 4
```

This will skip running any migrations but update `schema_migrations` table to think you've run them all up through 4

#### testing migrations

To test running migrations (against a separate `pgtest` database alongside your main `postgresio` database for dev), do the following (run from THIS top-level directory!):

```
docker compose up -d
bash apps/platform/migrations_test/test_migrations.sh
```

## End-to-end Testing and Integration testing

To run E2E and Integration tests locally, there are a number of commands available:

1. `npm run tests-all`
    - Runs all Integration and E2E tests against your local Uesio app.
    - Use this when writing and debugging tests locally
1. `npm run tests-ci`
    - This is what we run in Github Actions on `master` branch builds. It spins up all dependencies, and a Dockerized version of the Uesio app, runs integration and E2E tests against the app, and then spins down all Docker containers.
1. `npm run tests-integration`
    - Runs _just_ the Integration Tests (against your local app).
1. `npm run tests-e2e`
    - Runs _just_ the E2E Tests (against your local app).

TO run just an individual E2E or Integration test, see the sections below.

### E2E testing with Cypress

We use [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for writing end-to-end tests of the Uesio app. All E2E tests are defined in `cypress/e2e` directory.

E2E tests are the most expensive and most brittle, and as such should be used sparingly.

If you're running Uesio locally, you can use `npx cypress open` to launch Cypress' visual UI for running tests, or `npm run tests-e2e` to just run the tests in a headless runner.

#### Running a single E2E spec

If you want to _visually_ run a single spec, use the Cypress visual UI and then select the individual spec.

Or, use `npx cypress run --spec <path to spec>` to run a specific file in a headless Electron instance, e.g.

```
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/builder.cy.ts
```

### Integration / API testing with Hurl

We use [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/) for running integration tests against Uesio APIs, and for performing load testing against APIs. Hurl provides a powerful text-based abstraction over `curl` suitable for defining suites of HTTP requests and assertions to make upon the responses.

To run API integration tests locally against your running Uesio container, use `npm run tests-integration`

#### Running a single Integration Test

The easiest way to run a single Integration Test is to go into the `run-integration-tests.sh` file and comment out the lines where we run all tests, and uncomment the lines here:

```
hurl --very-verbose -k --variable host=studio.uesio-dev.com --variable domain=uesio-dev.com --variable port=3000 hurl_specs/wire_collection_dependencies.hurl
```

You could run this from the CLI, but you would have to make sure that you are (a) in the right directory (b) have the right environment variables set up. (See the top of this `run-integration-tests.sh` for a better understanding).

# Continous integration (CI)

We use **GitHub Actions** for automated builds. All of our workflows live in `./github/workflows`.

## Creating a new release

We use Github Releases to manage releases of:

(a) the Uesio web/worker app - as a Docker image
(b) the Uesio CLI - as a platform-specific binary

Here are the steps to create a new release:

1. In Github, go to [Draft a new release](https://github.com/ues-io/uesio/releases/new)
2. Enter a new tag name, using Semver names (e.g. `v0.5.0`)
3. Click **Generate release notes**
4. Click **Publish release**

That's it! This will kick off the "Release" Github Action, which will download the corresponding Docker image from AWS ECR and re-publish it to Github Container Registry with the corresponding version tag, as well as the `latest` tag. It will also generate CLI binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.

# Code style

As much as possible, our code style and format is codified with [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). We cherry-picked some rules from the [Airbnb JavaScriopt Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and the [React+TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react).

For Redux, we follow the [Redux Style Guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide) with some exceptions. More details on that [here](#redux-architecture).

For Go **package naming**, we follow this [guideline](https://blog.golang.org/package-names).
