# Uesio

![Uesio Logo](./libs/uesioapps/uesio/bundle/files/logo.png)

Uesio is a low-code application development platform.

## Set up dev environment

- install homebrew (for macOS user)
- install git
- install Oh My Zsh
- install nvm (nodejs and npm)
- ```
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```
- install Go
- install VS Code and plugins (ESLint, Prettier, Go, GitLens)
- clone repo
- ```
  npm install
  ```
- create a file called `launch.json` located in `apps/.vscode` for the uesio server debugger in go and paste the following :

```
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Launch",
        "type": "go",
        "request": "launch",
        "mode": "debug",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}",
        "env": {},
        "args": ["serve"]
      }
    ]
  }

```

## Build

```
npm run build-all
```

## Set up SSL

```
npm run setup-ssl
```

This script should create the `certificate.crt` and `private.key` files in the apps/platform/ssl directory. You will need to configure your operating system to trust this self-signed certificate.

In windows, double-click certificate.crt in the File Explorer. Click "Install Certificate..." Then place the certificate in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".

In mac, double-click certificate.crt in Finder. Right-click on the uesio-dev.com certificate and select "Get Info". Expand the "Trust" section and set it to "Always Trust".

## Set up DNS

On Mac modify the `/etc/hosts` file to include the following lines

```
127.0.0.1 uesio-dev.com
127.0.0.1 studio.uesio-dev.com
127.0.0.1 www.uesio-dev.com
```

Mac users can also use a service called dnsmasq for managing local DNS, but that has not been documented yet.

## Seed Local Database with Test Data

```
npm run nx -- seed platform
```

## Run Locally

```
npm run nx -- serve platform
```

In a browser visit

```
https://uesio-dev.com:3000
```

## Local Development with the Firestore Emulator

```
firebase init firestore
```

```
firebase emulators:start
```

In a browser visit

```
http://localhost:4000/firestore/
```

## Connecting to a real Firestore instance

1. First set up your google cloud SDK and your first project (see above)
2. Initialize Firestore to be "Native Firestore"
3. Follow the steps laid out here to get a application credentials json file.
   https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/quickstart-servers#set_up_authentication
4. Place this JSON content of this file in the GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY environment variable wrapped in `''`, example: `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY='{ JSON CONTENT }'`
5. Make sure that the FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST variable is either an empty string or not set.
6. `firebase emulators:start`
7. Try to run seeds
8. If seeds were successful - enjoy your cloud based firestore instance.
